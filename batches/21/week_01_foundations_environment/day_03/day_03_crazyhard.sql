/* ============================================================
   ACCIOJOB SQL PRACTICE SET â€” DAY 3 (CRAZY HARD LEVEL)
   Instructor: Sayyed Siraj Ali
   Topic: Data Onboarding + Constraints & Keys + UPSERT (Expert)
   Scope & Rules (STRICT):
     - Focus ONLY on constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, PK, FK),
       referential actions (ON DELETE/UPDATE ...), and UPSERT patterns.
     - Include advanced topics: DEFERRABLE constraints, deferred checks, transactional onboarding.
     - DDL/DML â†’ acciojob.daily     |     Read-only SELECT â†’ retailmart
     - No joins/filters beyond simple SELECTs for verification (joins proper come later days).
   Structure: 20 Conceptual + 40 Constraint/Key Tasks + 40 Practical/UPSERT Tasks = 100

   Instructions:
   - Use transactions and deferred constraints thoughtfully.
   - Keep DDL/DML in acciojob.daily; retailmart only for read-only checks.
