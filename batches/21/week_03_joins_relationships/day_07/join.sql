üî∏ Q2. Products Never Sold (Anti-Join Logic)

Concept: LEFT JOIN + NULL check.

SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE oi.order_id IS NULL;


üß© Teaches: detecting missing matches using LEFT JOIN.

üî∏ Q3. Customers and Their Last Known City Even If No Orders

Concept: LEFT JOIN to keep all customers; COALESCE to handle NULL city.

SELECT 
    c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer_name,
    COALESCE(ci.city_name, 'Unknown') AS city_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN cities ci ON c.city_id = ci.city_id;


üß© Teaches: LEFT JOIN + NULL handling using COALESCE.

üî∏ Q4. Orders Without Matching Store or Customer (Data Audit)

Concept: FULL JOIN to detect missing foreign keys.

SELECT 
    o.order_id, 
    o.customer_id, 
    c.customer_id AS matched_customer, 
    o.store_id, 
    s.store_id AS matched_store
FROM orders o
FULL JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
FULL JOIN stores s    ON o.store_id = s.store_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL OR s.store_id IS NULL;


üß© Teaches: FULL JOIN for mismatch detection.

üî∏ Q5. City-wise Revenue and Number of Orders

Concept: Multi-JOIN + aggregation with GROUP BY.

SELECT 
    ci.city_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
JOIN cities ci ON s.city_id = ci.city_id
GROUP BY ci.city_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;


üß© Teaches: multiple joins with GROUP BY on higher-level dimension.

üî∏ Q6. Product Category Sales With NULL Replacements

Concept: Handle missing category names using COALESCE.

SELECT 
    COALESCE(c.category_name, 'Uncategorized') AS category_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_sales
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY COALESCE(c.category_name, 'Uncategorized')
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;


üß© Teaches: LEFT JOIN + NULL handling in GROUP BY.

üî∏ Q7. Employee Count per Store Including Stores With No Employees

Concept: LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY.

SELECT 
    s.store_name,
    COUNT(e.employee_id) AS total_employees
FROM stores s
LEFT JOIN employees e ON s.store_id = e.store_id
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY total_employees DESC;


üß© Teaches: preserving unmatched rows using LEFT JOIN.

üî∏ Q8. Cross Join to Generate Product‚ÄìStore Availability Matrix

Concept: CROSS JOIN to show every possible combination.

SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    s.store_name
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN stores s
ORDER BY p.product_name, s.store_name;


üß© Teaches: Cartesian logic ‚Üí use carefully.

üî∏ Q9. Store Performance Category Using CASE

Concept: Derived column with CASE using JOIN results.

SELECT 
    s.store_name,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(o.total_amount) > 500000 THEN 'High Performer'
        WHEN SUM(o.total_amount) BETWEEN 200000 AND 500000 THEN 'Average'
        ELSE 'Low Performer'
    END AS performance_category
FROM stores s
LEFT JOIN orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
GROUP BY s.store_name;


üß© Teaches: CASE WHEN + aggregates.

üî∏ Q10. Compare Customer‚Äôs Order City vs Registered City

Concept: Join through multiple levels and conditional check.

SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    ci1.city_name AS registered_city,
    ci2.city_name AS order_city,
    CASE 
        WHEN ci1.city_name = ci2.city_name THEN 'Same City'
        ELSE 'Different City'
    END AS match_status
FROM customers c
JOIN cities ci1 ON c.city_id = ci1.city_id
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
JOIN cities ci2 ON s.city_id = ci2.city_id;


üß© Teaches: multi-level join + CASE logic.
